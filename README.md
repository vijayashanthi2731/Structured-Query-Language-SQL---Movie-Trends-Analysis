## Structured-Query-Language-SQL---Movie-Trends-Analysis

## Overview

  - This project demonstrates the application of SQL for analyzing a movie dataset. It covers importing data into SQL, performing various queries, and exploring concepts such as JOINs, 
    aggregate functions, subqueries, and logical operators.

## Features

   1. Data Import:
      
      - Step-by-step process for importing data from Excel to MySQL Workbench.
  
  2.  SQL Operations Covered:

      - Data retrieval using SELECT.
      - Filtering with WHERE.
      - Aggregation with GROUP BY and aggregate functions (MIN, MAX, SUM, etc.).
      - Sorting using ORDER BY.
      - Limiting results using LIMIT.
           
3. Advanced SQL Techniques:

     - Subqu-eries:
          - Single-row, multi-row, and nested subqueries.
     - SQL Joins:
          - Cartesian joins, INNER JOINs, OUTER JOINs, LEFT JOINs, RIGHT JOINs, and SELF JOINs.
     - Logical operators:
          - AND, OR, NOT.
     - Special operators:
          - LIKE, NOT LIKE, BETWEEN.
## Technologies Used
   
 - SQL: Structured Query Language for data manipulation and analysis.
 - MySQL Workbench: For database management and queries.
 - Excel: Source data for the project.

## Getting Started
 
  - Importing Data
  

      ![IMPORT DATA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2404de71-2b9a-4058-bbee-a5b1a50ba2ad)

 
  - Create a database named MOVIE.
